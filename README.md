# React Native News App - 'newsy' (WIP)
To learn some fundamental React Native concepts and put them into practice, I have developed a basic news app.

## Features
- Fetches BBC News headlines from newsapi
- Loading state while articles are being fetched
- Displays full article on a separate route

## Learnings/Concepts
- Styles in React Native using StyleSheet
- Using a FlatList to optimise large sets of data
- Using ActivityIndicator for loading state
- Navigation using native-stack
- SafeAreaView
- Deployment with Expo
